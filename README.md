# Background
I was recently working with a scale-up company in the product analytics space. They've got an amazing product, very product-led, great success record. Their challenge now is accelerating their growth. A big part of that strategy is to hire more customer facing folks. The core of the problem they face with that however is that because it's quite a technical product, with fairly technical customers (mostly engineers), their hiring bar is technically very high. That's great and yields great hires, but it also makes it really hard to find people, and so limits their ability to scale as quickly as they would like.

I saw a similar pattern in a previous role, we were selling solutions around Kubernetes and containers at the time, and the market for people that were skilled as sales & Kubernetes was basically us and 2 of our competitors, so the pool of people to hire from was really shallow. So I put together a set of resources that someone could use to get up to speed with the world of Kubernetes. This didn't lower our hiring bar, but it raised the bar of candidates we got. The people that really wanted the role put the effort in to go through the resources and learn more about our world. That meant when it came to interviewing, they had a much better understanding of what we were doing. I've always been strongly of the belief that as a technical person you can likely learn most new technical products, you just need the right resources. That's probably why I also found myself getting into the enablement function later on!
